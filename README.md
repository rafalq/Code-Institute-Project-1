Project Idea:  A Website For A Gym

This is my gym website which is the first Milestone Project in the Fullstack Web Developer course.

I decided to use the gym idea as I have already some experience on the fitness field. 

Nowadays kettlebells are very popular workout tools among men and women.

The website is designed for attracting new members of both sexes (there is a female trainer), from all age groups and of different fitness level who want to become fit and are interested especially in kettlebells.

I focused on certification preparation and martial arts classes what could be additional factor to encourage people to join in if they want to progress, upgrade skills or just challenge themselves.

The gym is more like a club and the idea behind this is to motivate people to struggle to become fitter by creating friendly atmosphere.

## UX

### User stories

Future members can find relevant information about the location, time-tables of relevant to them classes, a membership deal, instructors’ qualifications, contact details and a type of equipment being used.

Existing members look for a current timetable, contact details.

### Strategy

My goal in design was to make it easy to access relevant information about the gym in user-friendly manner.

### Scope

Future members. I wanted to provide relevant information, explain shortly the idea of the club, the equipment is being used for workout, focus on the things distinguishing the club from other gyms, enable an easy way to contact the club.

Existing members are provided with relevant information: the timetable that may be updated or changed, an online contact form, a mobile number, an access to other social networks.

### Structure

The website contains four pages (six sections):

1.	Home

In this section, I was hoping to show the subject of my project which is kettlebells as workout tools and a way to spend free time, by using a photograph and a brief description of its best qualities. 
There are also available 5 social media networks as sharing or contact methods. 

2.	About

Here I explained more of its gains and whom the group consists of. 

3.	Activities

Various forms and with that certifications of kettlebells are available depending on the interests and fitness level of the customer.

4.	 Coaches

Introducing available staff and providing the information about their relevant trainings and certifications in order to maintain safety throughout. 

5.	Timetable

Table-formulated information about days and times of the classes, contains pictures of the classes already explained in the Activities section.

6.	Contact

The last part has all the ways available to contact the staff.

### Colors

Grey colors are dominant in my website as the background. To emphasize important information in the foreground or to separate the sections I used more vibrant colors. All of them seem to harmonize with each other (red, orange, green).

### Technologies

1.	HTML
2.	CSS
3.	Bootstrap (4.3.1)


## Features

I used Bootstrap creating the navbar which is responsive and collapsible, 

CSS – hovered icons display their meaning, some important paragraphs change their color when are hovered to attract the attention.

### Features Left to Implement

I would add my own javascript to make the website more dynamic.


## Testing

The website can be open with the browsers:  Firefox (Version 70.0.1), Opera (Version 63.0.3), Internet Explorer (Version 11.0.9), Google Chrome (Version 77.0.3 ); responsive on mobiles, tablets, kindels.

1.	Home

Every clicked navabar link - navigates to a connected section (except for the social networks icons that are beyond the scope of the projects.)
The clicked two bottom paragraphs in the jumbotron - take to a form/message section.

2.	Activities section

Every clicked “Read more” button - opens a relevant websites in another browser window.

3.	Timetable section

Every hovered Timetable icon - displays their meaning.
Every clicked Timetable icon - gets you to the Activities section.

4.	Message section

Every clicked input fields - goes to an active mode.
Clicked “Send” button without filling in the form - displays “Please fill out this field” message.
Clicked “Send” button with an typed invalid email address – gives an error message.
